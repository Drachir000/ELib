# ELib
A Minecraft plugin that acts as a library for other plugin developers, allowing them to easily create and manage custom enchantments. It also handles the lore, anvil, and other aspects of managing these enchantments. This library is notable for allowing multiple custom enchantment plugins to run seamlessly and without conflicts.

List of some Ideas:
- Anvil support
- ETable support
- Villager support
- Grindstone support
- LootTables support
- (random) equipment / mob equipment support (Equippment of mobs)
- fully customizable Max lvl
- Roman Numbers go higher up
- customizable enchantments display
- customizable enchantment categories with weight (for the display)
- Enchantment Description

Intentions:
- **Much** mor easy to create Enchantments
- No overwriting between Enchantment-Plugins
- Much Customisability and Configurability for Enchantments (by Server Administration)

## WORK IN PROGRESS!!!
